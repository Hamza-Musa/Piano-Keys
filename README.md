## Project Goals

Youâ€™re a web developer who has been hired by a music education company. This client wants you to create an interactive game to help their beginner-level piano students study. Create a piano player with DOM events in JavaScript!

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git, GitHub and GitHub Pages

## Challenges and Credits

This was a practice project from the full stack program at Codeacademy.
<br>
**HTML and CSS were given to me, I did the JavaScript work.**
<br>
**Bonus: I added notes sounds by myself.**

## Optimizations/Improvements

- Adding sound
- Adding other songs
- Continue refining the design
- More fun Interactivity

## Lessons Learned:

- DOM Manipulation: Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation in JavaScript. I learned how to dynamically interact with HTML elements, such as creating event listeners and updating content based on user input.

- Event Handling: Implementing event handling was a crucial aspect of this project. I learned how to capture and respond to user actions, such as mouse clicks or keyboard inputs, to create an interactive user experience.

- Project Collaboration: While HTML and CSS were provided, I took ownership of the JavaScript functionality. This project taught me the importance of collaboration, as well as the significance of integrating different technologies seamlessly to achieve project goals.

- Problem-Solving Skills: Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges and bugs that required creative problem-solving skills to resolve. These challenges provided opportunities for growth and helped me develop my debugging abilities.

- Continuous Improvement: Reflecting on this project, I realize the importance of continuous improvement. Moving forward, I aim to refine the design, add additional features such as more songs, and enhance the interactivity to provide users with an even more enjoyable experience.
